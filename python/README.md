# Python examples for Platform.sh

This project is a showcase for working with services supported by Platform.sh. Each example connects to a different service using the Platform.sh Python configuration library, `platformshconfig`. 

You can install the configuration library using:

    pip install platformshconfig

Each example provides a starter kit for connecting to these services and working with the configuration library, which can be expanded to larger projects. You can find additional information about using [Python on Platform.sh](https://docs.platform.sh/languages/python.html) and the individual [Services](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/services.html) in our [Public Documentation](https://docs.platform.sh/).

## Python supported versions

* 3.5
* 3.6
* 3.7

## Using as a reference

You can also use this repository as a reference for your own projects, and borrow whatever code is needed. The most important parts are the `.platform.app.yaml` file and the `.platform` directory.
